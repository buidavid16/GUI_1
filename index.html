 Short Description: This is the front page of my website which I will be using for GUI I. It has some personal
                    information about me and my student life. In the future, I plan on using this page to add
                    more assignments and other updates needed for the semester.

     Hi there! My name is David Bui, and I am currently a senior Computer Science major at the University
     of<br> Massachusetts Lowell. Outside of my academic major, I work as a Resident Advisor for the
     university<br> and also do Air Force ROTC. I hope to become a cyber officer in the Air Force and then
     pursue a<br> career in cyber security later on in life. The reason why I'm taking GUI is because I am
     also an interested in<br> learning HTML, CSS, and a bunch of other languages necessary to writing a good
     website. Here's to hoping<br> I can make the most out of this school year!
